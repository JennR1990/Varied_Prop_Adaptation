I want to take our old two-rate model code and change it so that it takes into account a few different things.

We think there is an attenuation parameter, so a value that reduces the amount of learning
     Reach directions <- (learning algorithm) * AP



```{r}
#combine all reaches and localizations into 1 dataframe
getallparticipants(3)
getPassiveTaps(3)
#get angles they tapped and reached to
GetTapAngles(3)
GetReachAngles(3)
```
